# Kaibu

Kaibu is a web application for visualizing and annotating multi-dimensional images, built with [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/) and [itk-vtk-viewer](https://kitware.github.io/itk-vtk-viewer/).


# Why Kaibu?

`Kaibu` is an small island in Fiji, and we name it to pay tribute to the open source image processing package [Fiji](https://fiji.sc/)/[ImageJ](https://imagej.net). The layered design of Kaibu is also heavily inspired by [Napari](https://napari.org/) which is also named after an island. `Kaibu` in Chinese, it means "to step forward", and yes, it time to step forward with Kaibu!
